/**
 *  A `State` represents a distinct condition or configuration within a state machine, reflecting
 *  a specific circumstance that an entity, governed by the state machine, might be in.
 *
 *  In a state machine, a `State` encapsulates specific behaviors and transitions. Each `State`
 *  can define actions that occur when entering or exiting the state, as well as behaviors and
 *  transitions to other states based on events. States can be connected through transitions,
 *  forming a graph that represents the entire lifecycle of an entity.
 *
 *  In a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM), states can have a parent-child relationship, forming a
 *  hierarchy of states. A `State` in HSM can be a composite state containing sub-states, or
 *  a simple state with no sub-states. This hierarchy allows for more organized and modular design,
 *  where common behaviors can be grouped and managed in parent states, while specific behaviors
 *  are handled in child states.
 *
 *  The `State` interface in this package provides a blueprint for implementing states in a state
 *  machine, defining lifecycle methods such as [onEnter] and [onExit], and a method for processing
 *  events to handle transitions.
 *
 *  Nested within are also special types of states like [Initial] for designating a starting point
 *  in the state machine, [Normal] for providing a basic implementation, and [Transient] for
 *  handling initial transitions.
 *
 *  __Usage__:
 *  Implementing classes may define the behavior on entering and exiting the state(if they inherits
 *  from State interface), and how events are processed to determine transitions to other
 *  states.
